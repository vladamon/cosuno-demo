# Companies Search - Demo

Companies Search - Demo is a small take-home assignment with simple UI built in React. It features basic logic for
interactively searching a list of companies and additional filtering based od the predefined criteria.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run this to install dependencies:

```javascript
cd cosuno-demo

NOTE: Please use Node v16 - note the latest version
npm install
```

Since there are two packages - React based client and a server combined in monorepo organized with Lerna, after installing dependencies, you should bootstrap it with:

```javascript
lerna bootstrap // (for this you need to have lerna globally) or
npx lerna bootstrap // (without installation)
```

## Usage

Voila, you're ready to go! Just run this from the root:

```javascript
npm run dev
```

Your client app will run on the http://localhost:3000 (or some other port if this is taken). From there you can start playing with the app :)

Your local server will run on the http://localhost:8000

Happy using experience!
